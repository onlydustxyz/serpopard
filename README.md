## ❓ Reference 

The Serpopard is an unusual example of a mythical creature for which no name has been adduced from the historical records: all we know is that depictions of creatures with the body of a leopard and the head of a snake adorn various Egyptian ornaments.

One theory is that Serpopards represented the chaos and barbarism lurking beyond the borders of Egypt during the pre-dynastic period (over 5,000 years ago).

The Serpopard, Harbinger of Chaos ? Well, a code coverage tool can also bring the chaos in a project, right ?
